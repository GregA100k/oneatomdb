# oneatomdb

A Clojure library designed to do queries against a map as if it were a database.

All the data that drives an om site is stored inside an atom.  One atom.
In the old TV series [Adam-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam-12) the
radio calls always started out "One Adam-12. One Adam-12.  See the ..." and
the officers were off in pursuit.  

This library treats that one atom like a database and provides quering tools
to pull data out of that one atom database.

In order for this to work, the map-database needs to have top level keys
that represent the names of the database tables 
with values that are lists of maps.  The inner maps represent the rows
of the database table.  The keys of the inner map are the column 
names and the values are the data.

## Usage

The seethe function is used to get data out of the map

>(seethe mapdb toplevelkey)
>(seethe mapdb toplevelkey wherethe columnname comparison columnvalue)

>(def dbmap (atom
>          {:runners [{:firstname "Fast" :lastname "Runner" :racenumber "3"}
>                     {:firstname "Slow" :lastname "Runner" :racenumber "4"}
>                     {:firstname "Anon" :lastname "Ymous" :racenumber "5"}
>                    ] }))
>
>(seethe @dbmap :runners "wherethe" :lastname = "Runner")
>
>(seethe @dbmap :runners "wherethe" ["orthe" :racenumber = 3 :racenumber = 4])

The columnname doesn't have to be a keyword, it just needs to be a function
which will operate on the map.  If there were a fullname function that 
put together the first name and lastname, then it can be used in a "wherethe"

>(seethe @db2 :runners "wherethe" fullname = "Fast Runner")


More than one list can be joined together using a format similar to the 
wherethe format.  The keys for the joined together maps will be prefixed
with the key to the list, :firstname in :runners becomes :runners.firstname.
This joined keyword has to be used in wherethe parameters.

>(def app-state (atom
>           {:runners [{:firstname "Greg" :lastname "Allen" :racenumber "3"}
>                      {:firstname "Another" :lastname "Allen" :racenumber "4"}
>                      {:firstname "Anon" :lastname "Ymous" :racenumber "5"} ]
>            :laps    [{:runnernumber "3" :course "l" :elapsedtime 20778} ]
>            :courses [{:name "Long Loop" :id "l" :distance 3.35}
>                      {:name "Short Loop" :id "s" :distance 1} ]
>           }))
>

Here is an example query given the atom with :runners, :courses, and :laps.

>(seethe @app-state ["jointhe" :runners :laps "onthe" :runners.racenumber = :laps.runnernumber :courses "onthe" :laps.course = :courses.id] wherethe :runners.racenumber = "3")
>
>({:runners.firstname "Greg" :runners.lastname "Allen" :runners.racenumber "3"
            :laps.runnernumber "3" :laps.course "l" :laps.elapsedtime 20778
            :courses.id "l" :courses.name "Long Loop" :courses.distance 3.35})

Coming Up
=========
- look at replacing the "wherethe", "andthe", "orthe", "jointhe" labels with functions
- project only certain keys from the returned list
