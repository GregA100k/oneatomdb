# oneatomdb

A Clojure library designed to do queries against a map as if it were a database.

All the data that drives an om site is stored inside an atom.  One atom.
This library treats that atom like a database and provides quering tools
to pull data out of that one atom database.

In the old TV series [Adam-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam-12) the
radio calls always started out "One Adam-12. One Adam-12.  See the ..." and
the officers were off in pursuit.  

## Usage

The seethe function is used to get data out of the map
