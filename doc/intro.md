# Introduction to oneatom

Assumptions are:

- Inside the map will be keys to lists of data objects
- There will be no schema
- if keys are missing, the data just will not be returned


Right now:
seethe can return the top level values
seethe can filter the top level values by a single field

Coming up:
filter the results from the top level values
project only certain keys from the returned list
combine results from different top level keys
