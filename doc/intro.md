# Introduction to oneatom

Assumptions are:

- Inside the map will be keys to lists of data objects
- There will be no schema
- if keys are missing, the data just will not be returned


Right now:
seethe can return the top level values
seethe can filter the top level values by a single field
seethe can filter the top level values by multiple fields 'and'ing the results

Coming up:
handle values that are not strings
handle 'or' or combinations of 'and' and 'or'
project only certain keys from the returned list
combine results from different top level keys
